# Enhancing Information Retrieval using Multi Word Expressions on Biomedical Text

This repository contains the starter code for biomedical-mwe-ir , which involves investigating Multi Word Expressions (MWEs) to enhance information retrieval on biomedical texts

## Project Overview

The respository files are as follows:

1. **Report**: This folder contains the detailed report outlining the project, its objectives, methodology, and findings.

2. **Starter Code**: This folder contains the initial codebase for setting up the index in Elasticsearch and querying it. Please note that the indexes are not available in this repository. If you require access to the indexes, kindly send an email to [shlok.kothari@rutgers.edu](mailto:shlok.kothari@rutgers.edu), and I will share the Google Drive folder containing the index with you.
